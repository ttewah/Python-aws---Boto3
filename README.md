# Python-aws-Boto3
This repo consists of a Python project which uploads and downloads a txt file to and from AWS using Boto3.
The text file named "Exercise1.txt" was uploaded to AWS, and the text file named "download-file.txt was downloaded from AWS.
Both files are located in the javascript-aws directory (https://github.com/Cup-Of-JavaScript/javascript-aws).
I had to put the file to be uploaded to aws in that directory inorder for my code to run.
